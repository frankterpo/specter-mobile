      "about": "I am a technology leader who is passionate about transforming and scaling businesses, creating customer-centric products, building inclusive and collaborative teams. \n\nI currently lead the go-to-market and solution sales functions, with responsibility over the six Solution Areas of the Microsoft Cloud (Azure Infrastructure, Data & AI, Digital & App Innovation, Modern Work, Business Applications, and Security) delivering $100B+ in annual commercial revenue. The Commercial Solution Areas team defines the solutions that Microsoft offers, and facilitates conversations with customers about the purpose, capability, and value of these solutions at scale. We also represent the voice of the customer and channel it internally to influence product roadmaps and solution offerings. This work ensures the Microsoft Cloud is continuously optimized for customers to realize business value in a dynamic marketplace.  \n\nI’ve spent 26 years of my career in product engineering at Microsoft. Most recently, I led product and design for Azure Infrastructure, delivering infrastructure offerings that power the world’s workloads. I’m a platform and systems builder at heart, contributing to more than 15 operating system releases in various product leadership positions at Microsoft. \n\nOne of my favorite projects was helping to transform the Program Management discipline, creating specialized roles and career paths including Product Management, Technical Program Management and Customer Experience Program Management roles. Through this work, we were able to provide greater clarity and industry alignment for thousands of roles within the company, simplify recruiting for HR, and better support our employees’ career growth, mobility, and business impact.\n\nThis work underscores my belief that the greatest source of strength for any organization is its people. In every role, I am intentional about building solid, healthy teams, creating connection and community, and enriching team culture with inclusion and allyship. It is important to me that people feel comfortable to be themselves at work, and have the freedom and support to bring their best ideas forward.\n\nOriginally from Canada, I am naturally a huge hockey fan, and split my loyalties between the Vancouver Canucks and Seattle Kraken. When not at work, I love traveling and learning about new cultures, cooking to rejuvenate my energy, and planning elaborate Halloween costumes with my family.",
