        "about": "The world is handing the keys of a Ferrari to every health marketing team on the planet. That Ferrari is Generative AI. It allows brands to move at 200mph. But without a seatbelt (trustworthy compliance) that speed creates a massive legal risk.\n\nWe are building that seatbelt.\n\nMy obsession with this problem started 15 years ago on the floor of Procter & Gamble, where I experience firsthand how \"Legal\" was the bottleneck to growth.\n\nI spent the next decade building the skillset to solve it: \n\nAt Palantir: I learned how to deploy data infrastructure into complex, critical environments.\nAt Citi: I managed a $2.8B P&L and navigated the regulatory chaos of Brexit as Chief of Staff to the UK CEO.\nAt Wheely: I led operations during \"wartime,\" relocating 23% of our workforce during the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war while reaching profitability.\n\nNow, I am combining that operational experience with the medical knowledge of my co-founder (Dr. Leonie Bode) to solve one of the biggest problems in the $600B Longevity Economy.\n\nWe are the department of \"Yes!\" We utilise proprietary AI to validate and localise their claims instantly, turning compliance from a bottleneck into a growth engine.\n\n3x Scale-Up Operator turned Founder. Competitive CrossFit Athlete. On a mission to bring truth to health commerce.",
